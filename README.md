## ERIC FADDEN: Documenting my journey into...documentation ðŸ‘‹
___
#### Technologist. Sysad. Consultant. Sales and Marketing Copywriter. The one the company turns to when they need something written internally. Separately, they're five different careers. Together, well, they're me. I've decided to put it all together and start a journey into documentation and technical writing. This is where I'll journal and blog it.
___

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: GitHub, Markdown, Hugo, Jekyll
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: this site, adding content, finding unique things to document 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: cats, Apple stuff, why most companies get their messaging wrong
- :tv: I'm currently watching: Severence, Shrinking, Snowfall (re-watch before current season)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I wrote a blog post that has over 2.5 million views. You've probably read it.
